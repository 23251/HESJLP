# Medicaid Is Changing: patient education site

A small, plain website that puts the content of five printed flyers and posters online for Illinois Medicaid patients and families. Patients reach it from a QR code on the flyer, so it is built for phones first. It is plain HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. There is no build step and nothing to install.

The site asks each visitor once whether they are a patient or a provider. A patient or provider answer is saved as one row in a Supabase table so the project can count how many patients use the site. No names, no personal data.

## What is where

| Path | What it is |
|---|---|
| `index.html` | Home page. Topic buttons, "Does this apply to you?", key dates, 3 things to do, links to every page. |
| `keep-your-medicaid.html` | Work requirements, exemptions, keeping coverage, non-citizens, what to do if you lose Medicaid. |
| `get-care.html` | Where to get care without Medicaid: ER, community health centers, CareLink, hospital bills, kids and pregnancy. |
| `clinics.html` | Free and low-cost clinics in Cook County, with addresses, phone links, and map links. |
| `who-to-call.html` | Every phone number and website on the site in one list. |
| `about.html` | What the site is and who made it, plus the full **Sources** list (`about.html#sources`), grouped by topic. Edit the placeholder text here. |
| `assets/css/base.css` | Layout and components for every page. Colors, fonts, and shapes come from the theme file. |
| `assets/css/theme-green.css` | Theme A: the flyer's green and mint palette. This is the default. |
| `assets/css/theme-civic.css` | Theme B: navy and gold, public-service look. |
| `assets/css/theme-warm.css` | Theme C: cream, teal, and coral, soft clinic look. |
| `assets/js/site.js` | Skip link, mobile menu, and the theme preview switch. |
| `assets/js/visitor-count.js` | The patient/provider prompt and the Supabase save. |
| `config.js` | Supabase project URL, public key, and table name. |
| `supabase/schema.sql` | Creates the table and its security rules. Run once in Supabase. |
| `scripts/verify-supabase.sh` | Checks the database rules from the command line. |
| `previews/` | Screenshots of every page in every theme, and a side-by-side compare page. |
| `.open-design/` | Open Design's record of the three design directions, with a compare page and contact sheet. |
| `.claude/`, `.mcp.json` | Open Design tooling for Claude Code. Not part of the website. |

## Preview the site on your computer

Option 1: double-click `index.html`. Everything works from a file, including the visitor prompt.

Option 2: serve the folder, which matches how GitHub Pages serves it:

```bash
python3 -m http.server 8000
```

Then open http://localhost:8000 in a browser. Use your browser's device toolbar (F12, then the phone icon) to view it at phone width.

## Look at the three renderings

All three themes share the same HTML. To view a theme, add `?theme=` to any page address:

- `index.html?theme=green` (the flyer palette, default)
- `index.html?theme=civic`
- `index.html?theme=warm`

The choice is remembered in that browser until you pick another. Screenshots of every page in every theme are in `previews/`, and `previews/index.html` shows them side by side. Open Design's own comparison of the three directions is at `.open-design/a-mobile-first-public-health-education-website-f/compare.html`.

### Choose one theme for good

1. In every HTML file, change the `href` of the `<link id="theme-css">` tag in the `<head>` to the theme file you want, and set `data-theme="..."` on the `<html>` tag to match (`green`, `civic`, or `warm`).
2. Delete the two theme files you are not using.
3. Optional: in `assets/js/site.js`, delete section 3 (the theme preview switch) so `?theme=` does nothing.

A quick way to do step 1 for all pages from a terminal, for example to choose `warm`:

```bash
sed -i 's/theme-green\.css/theme-warm.css/; s/data-theme="green"/data-theme="warm"/' *.html
```

## Edit the content

Every page is a normal HTML file. Open it in any text editor.

- **Change a word, date, or number.** Find the text in the page and change it. Phone numbers appear twice: once as the visible text and once in the `href="tel:+1..."` link. Change both.
- **Add a section.** Each section is a `<section id="..."> ... </section>` block with an HTML comment above it naming the section. Copy an existing section, give it a new `id` and a new `<h2>`, and edit the text inside. Keep one `<h1>` per page.
- **Add a clinic.** In `clinics.html`, copy one `<li class="clinic">` block and change the name, address, phone, and map link. The map link is a Google Maps search for the address.
- **Add a page.** Copy `about.html`, rename it, change the `<title>`, the `<meta name="description">`, and the `<h1>`. Then add a link to it in the `<nav>` of every page and in the "Find what you need" cards on `index.html`.
- **Cite a source.** At the end of a section or card that states a fact, add one line: `<p class="source-note">Source: <a href="URL" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Short name</a></p>` ("Sources:" with commas for more than one). Add any new source to the Sources list on `about.html` and update its "Last checked" date.
- **Change "Information checked Nov. 2026".** It appears in the footer of every page. Search for it and change it everywhere.

Keep the writing plain: short sentences, no jargon, phone numbers as digits. Keep text contrast high and tap targets large. The class names in `assets/css/base.css` are listed in a comment at the top of that file.

## Publish changes

The site is meant to be served by GitHub Pages from the root of the repository.

One-time setup:

1. On GitHub, open the repository, then **Settings**, then **Pages**.
2. Under **Build and deployment**, choose **Deploy from a branch**, pick the `main` branch and the `/ (root)` folder, and save.
3. After a minute, the page shows the public address. Put that address in the QR code on the flyers.

To publish a change afterward: commit and push to `main`. GitHub Pages updates in about a minute.

```bash
git add -A
git commit -m "Describe the change"
git push
```

## Visitor count (Supabase)

### How it works

On the first visit in a browser, `assets/js/visitor-count.js` shows a small window: "Who is visiting today?" with three choices: patient or family member, provider or staff, or skip. The answer is remembered in that browser (localStorage key `hesjlp-visitor`), so the prompt never shows there again and repeat visits are not counted. A patient or provider answer is sent as one row, `{"role": "patient"}` or `{"role": "provider"}`, to the table `visitor_responses`. Skip sends nothing.

If Supabase is down, paused, or unreachable, the pages work normally. The answer is simply not counted. Nothing is retried later.

The key in `config.js` is Supabase's public "publishable" key. It is meant to be visible in web pages. The security rules in `supabase/schema.sql` are what protect the data: with that key, a visitor can add one patient or provider row and can never read, change, or delete rows.

### One-time setup

1. Sign in at https://supabase.com/dashboard and open the project.
2. Left menu: **SQL Editor**, then **New query**.
3. Paste the whole contents of `supabase/schema.sql` and click **Run**. Running it again later is safe. It never deletes saved answers.
4. Check it from a terminal in this folder. Every line should say PASS. Each run adds one test row with role `provider`, never `patient`.

```bash
scripts/verify-supabase.sh https://bgwaofspmqaxnhpsbwvy.supabase.co sb_publishable_5Tfjj-lpZHxYzpJFHWbBTA_uJMJFyai
```

This was run on Nov. 4, 2026 and every check passed.

### View the data

- **Table Editor:** in the dashboard, left menu **Table Editor**, then `visitor_responses`. This shows every row.
- **SQL Editor**, totals by role:

```sql
select role, count(*) from public.visitor_responses group by role order by role;
```

- Per day, Chicago time:

```sql
select (created_at at time zone 'America/Chicago')::date as day, role, count(*)
from public.visitor_responses group by day, role order by day desc, role;
```

Only the project owner can read these. The public website key cannot.

### Restore a paused database

Supabase pauses free-plan projects after about a week with no activity. It sends an email first. A paused project keeps its data but does not accept requests.

1. Open https://supabase.com/dashboard and select the project.
2. Click **Restore project**. It takes a few minutes.
3. Run `scripts/verify-supabase.sh` again to confirm.

While the project is paused, the site still works and the prompt still shows, but answers are not counted. The dashboard says how long a paused project can still be restored, so do not leave it paused for months.

### Turn the count off

In `config.js`, set `supabaseUrl: ""`. The prompt no longer appears.

### See the prompt again in your own browser

Open any page with `?resetvisitor=1` added to the address, for example `index.html?resetvisitor=1`. Or run `localStorage.removeItem('hesjlp-visitor')` in the browser console and reload.

## Verification checklist

## Cost

Everything runs on free tiers: GitHub Pages and a Supabase free-plan project. No card is needed.

## Design notes

The three directions were planned with Open Design (the `open-design` tooling in `.claude/` and `.mcp.json`). The brief and the three direction descriptions are recorded under `.open-design/`. In a Claude Code session with that tooling, you can ask it to show the comparison, pick a direction, or explore new ones.
